Data Types
int
    - sbyte -127 a 128
    - short -32k a 32k
    - int -2b a 2b
    - long -9,000,000,000,000,000,000 a 9,000,000,000,000,000,000

    use the smallest data type your value fits in

float
    - float add f at the end 1.99f. 7 digit precision (high demands for processing power)
    - double 15 digit precision (except money calculations, there we use decimal)
    - decimal 28 digit precision (high level of accuracy)

bool
    
char
    - contains a single letter or unicode

string
    - allows multiple letters and unicodes

They are usually saved in the stack (RAM)
They can be stored in the heap if they are part of reference type (field in class or element in array,strings)
reference stores where it is saved. reference is smaller in bites required
An object could be reeally big and require a lot of memory, reference makes it more performant
