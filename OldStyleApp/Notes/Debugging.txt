Auto shows the variables in our breakpints and their values
    - very handy to look at values
    - we can modify values

Breakpoints work the same as in VSCode

Watch
    - add specific items you want to look at

Local
    - shows variables in the local scope we are at

Callstack
    - shows order of calls, all the way up to the initial call, to track the behaviour

We can throw error like:
    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("variable of problem", "reason/message");
