4 Kind of Loops
For loop (same as in c++), for control over iteration process
While loop (same as in c++), when you dont know how many times to loop
Do while (same as in c++) do{this}while(codition), runs at least once
ForEach. runs through array as long a there is content, when needed to traverse objects but dont need index
