Access mofifiers

this helps with encapsulatoin and helps with data integrity by only changing it through certain ways
it applies abstraction hides internal implementation and reduce complecity

    private: only class can access that data
    public: anyone can access it
    protected: only the own class and its children can access it



we can define read only and write only properties
read only has only get accessor
write nnly has only set accessor

Readonly aplica para inmutable data como cumpleaños o computed data

write only puede ser para sensitive data que debe ingresarse pero no aparecer en la aplicación

===========
Inheritance
    -Define a class in terms of other class
    -take functinoality from one class and construct from it
